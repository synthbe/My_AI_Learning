## My Machile Learning road learning
This repository serves as a collection of my learnings about Machile Learning and Data Science, gathered from sources and videos available that I find.

### Purpose
My primary aim in this repository is just to store my codes in which I am using to learn and understand new concepts and techniques by appling them to datasets that I find nteresting. I often find datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to work with.

### Tools and Frameworks
I primarily use Python to familiarize myself with libraries and frameworks, especially TensorFlow and Keras. Also, I intend to learn the low level of the algorithms and implement them in c++. Sill far from it though.

### Future Goals
My hope is to gain a good understanding of Machine Learning and Data Science using these languages.
